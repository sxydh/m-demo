                    System.Drawing.Point(int x, int y)
                Size
                    System.Drawing.Size(int width, int height)
                Dock
                    The Dock property sets which border of the control is aligned to the corresponding side of the parent, and how the control is resized within the parent.
                    When a control is docked, the container determines the space it should occupy and resizes and places the control. 
                        If the control is docked to the top, the Height of the control is respected but the Width is automatically adjusted.
                        If a control is docked to the left, the Width of the control is respected but the Height is automatically adjusted.
                    The Location of the control can't be manually set as docking a control automatically controls its position.
                Anchor
                    Anchoring a control allows you to tie the control to one or more sides of the parent container. 
                    As the container changes in size, any child control will maintain its distance to the anchored side.
                AutoSize
                    The AutoSize property enables a control to change its size, if necessary, to fit the size specified by the PreferredSize property.
                    Only some controls support the AutoSize property. In addition, some controls that support the AutoSize property also supports the AutoSizeMode property.

                    Form
                        The Form is the main object of Windows Forms. A Windows Forms application will usually have a form displayed at all times.

                        The FlowLayoutPanel control arranges its contents in a horizontal or vertical flow direction.
                    TableLayoutPanel
                        The TableLayoutPanel control arranges its contents in a grid.
